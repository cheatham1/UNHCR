"There is no mention in the provided text of any domestic laws or policies in the United Kingdom requiring persons to obtain a work permit to engage in wage-earning employment. Therefore, I am unable to answer your question. However, the document does contain information about employment for asylum seekers:
Access to the Labour Market (page 79): According to the report, asylum seekers in the UK do not have general access to the labor market. However, they can apply for permission to work if their claim has been outstanding for a year. If permission is granted, employment is limited to specific sectors with shortages. Self-employment is not allowed, and there are restrictions on employment even with permission.
Access to Education (page 80): The report states that there are no bars on asylum seekers entering education and that education is compulsory for children from 5 to 16. However, destitution may affect access to education, and unaccompanied children lag behind their UK counterparts. There are some provisions for childcare and early learning programs.
Employment and Education (page 118): The law provides refugees and those with humanitarian protection the same access to the labor market as UK citizens. In practice, some may need to address qualification issues, language barriers, and may need to re-train. The UK also has a Refugee Employability Programme to support refugees in finding work. Refugees have access to compulsory education, and access to school places is related more to the geographical area than immigration status. There are differences in access to post-18 education between refugees and those with humanitarian protection, with refugees having more benefits. In Scotland, refugees are considered home students for fees and support once they receive status, while those with humanitarian protection are considered overseas students until they have lived in the UK for 3 years.
The report also includes a glossary that defines humanitarian protection as ""subsidiary protection in the meaning of the Qualification Directive 2011/95/EU"" (page 6). However, it does not define the terms refugees, subsidiary protection, asylum seekers, or indefinite leave to remain.
The specific section that discusses employment for asylum seekers is on page 79. There are no paragraph numbers in the document.

Therefore, I cannot provide any specific legal provisions or analysis on this topic.
However, I can offer some general information based on my understanding of UK employment law:
General Requirement: Generally, individuals who are not British citizens require permission to work in the UK. This permission is typically granted through a visa that includes the right to work. Some common visa categories that allow individuals to work in the UK include Skilled Worker visas, Global Talent visas, and Youth Mobility Scheme visas.
Refugees: By law, refugees are allowed to work in the UK. Once someone is granted refugee status in the UK, they have the right to work under the same conditions as a British citizen. This is in accordance with the 1951 Refugee Convention, which the UK has signed and is therefore bound to.
Asylum Seekers: Asylum seekers in the UK do not have the right to work while their claim is being processed. However, if someone has been waiting for a decision on their asylum claim for more than 12 months, they may apply for permission to work. If permission is granted, they will be allowed to work in a limited number of jobs where there are shortages.
Other Categories: I do not have the same level of knowledge about the specific requirements for individuals with humanitarian protection, subsidiary protection, or indefinite leave to remain. However, it is likely that they will also have specific rules and regulations regarding their right to work in the UK.
Please note that this information is of a general nature and should not be considered legal advice. It is important to consult with an immigration lawyer or other qualified professional for specific guidance on UK work permit requirements. Additionally, UK immigration laws and policies are subject to change, so it is important to check for the latest updates and guidance.

"The provided text focuses on the broader issue of access to the labor market rather than specifically addressing work permits. It outlines several challenges faced by asylum seekers and refugees in the UK regarding employment, which can be interpreted as indirectly related to the difficulties they might face in obtaining necessary permissions to work. There is no direct mention of ""work permit"" as a specific legal instrument.
Asylum Seekers (page 79): The document explicitly states that asylum seekers do not have general access to the labor market. This is a significant restriction. While they can apply for permission to work if their claim has been outstanding for a year, even if granted, employment is limited to jobs where there are shortages. This restriction, coupled with the waiting period, presents a major obstacle to engaging in wage-earning employment. The document implies that the lack of access to the labor market creates integration barriers for asylum seekers.
Refugees (page 118): While recognized refugees have the same access to the labor market as UK citizens, the document acknowledges that practical challenges exist. These include qualification issues, language barriers, and the need for retraining. These challenges, while not directly related to obtaining a ""work permit"" (as the right to work is inherent in refugee status), can significantly hinder effective access to employment. The document highlights the importance of support programs to overcome these obstacles.
Humanitarian Protection (page 118): Individuals with humanitarian protection also have the same access to the labor market as UK citizens, similar to refugees. Therefore, they likely face similar practical challenges regarding qualifications, language, and retraining, although the document does not explicitly state this.
Subsidiary Protection: The document does not mention specific challenges, restrictions, obstacles, or difficulties faced by beneficiaries of subsidiary protection in accessing employment.
Indefinite Leave to Remain: Individuals with indefinite leave to remain have the right to work in the UK without restrictions, so the document does not discuss any challenges they might face in this regard.

"Based on the provided text, here's an analysis of the challenges faced by refugees and asylum seekers in the UK regarding employment:
Asylum Seekers (page 79):
General Lack of Access: The primary challenge is the general lack of access to the labor market. Asylum seekers are not allowed to work while their claim is being processed.
Waiting Period: Even if their claim is eventually successful, asylum seekers must wait 12 months before they can apply for permission to work. This lengthy waiting period can create financial hardship and hinder integration prospects.
Restricted Employment: If permission to work is granted, employment is limited to specific sectors where there are shortages. This restriction limits their choices and may not align with their skills or experience.
Refugees (page 118):
Practical Challenges: While recognized refugees have the same access to the labor market as UK citizens, they often face practical challenges that hinder their ability to secure employment.
Qualification Issues: Refugees may have qualifications that are not recognized in the UK, requiring them to undergo further training or education.
Language Barriers: Language barriers can make it difficult for refugees to find and maintain employment.
Retraining Needs: Refugees may need to retrain in order to meet the requirements of the UK labor market.
Humanitarian Protection (page 118):
Individuals with humanitarian protection also have the same access to the labor market as UK citizens. However, the document does not explicitly mention any specific challenges they may face. It is likely that they experience similar practical challenges as refugees, such as qualification issues, language barriers, and the need for retraining.
Subsidiary Protection:
The document does not mention any specific challenges, restrictions, obstacles, or difficulties faced by beneficiaries of subsidiary protection in accessing employment.
Indefinite Leave to Remain:
Individuals with indefinite leave to remain have the right to work in the UK without restrictions. Therefore, the document does not discuss any challenges they might face in this regard.

Therefore, I cannot provide any specific legal provisions or analysis on this topic.
However, I can offer some general information based on my understanding of UK employment law:
General Requirement: Generally, individuals who are not British citizens require permission to work in the UK. This permission is typically granted through a visa that includes the right to work. Some common visa categories that allow individuals to work in the UK include Skilled Worker visas, Global Talent visas, and Youth Mobility Scheme visas.
Refugees: By law, refugees are allowed to work in the UK. Once someone is granted refugee status in the UK, they have the right to work under the same conditions as a British citizen. This is in accordance with the 1951 Refugee Convention, which the UK has signed and is therefore bound to.
Asylum Seekers: Asylum seekers in the UK do not have the right to work while their claim is being processed. However, if someone has been waiting for a decision on their asylum claim for more than 12 months, they may apply for permission to work. If permission is granted, they will be allowed to work in a limited number of jobs where there are shortages.
Other Categories: I do not have the same level of knowledge about the specific requirements for individuals with humanitarian protection, subsidiary protection, or indefinite leave to remain.

However, based on general knowledge of UK immigration law, I can offer some broad observations:
Refugees: Recognized refugees in the UK are generally eligible to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), which is a form of permanent residency, after a qualifying period of residence. While the right to apply exists, challenges can arise in meeting the specific requirements, which may include demonstrating sufficient knowledge of English, passing a Life in the UK test, and meeting certain financial requirements. Gathering the necessary documentation and navigating the application process can also be difficult.
Asylum Seekers: Asylum seekers do not have access to permanent residency status while their claim is being processed. They must first be recognized as refugees to be eligible to apply for ILR. The asylum process itself can be complex and challenging, and a significant proportion of claims are rejected.
Humanitarian Protection: Individuals granted humanitarian protection may also be eligible to apply for ILR after a qualifying period, but the specific requirements and process may differ from those for refugees.
Subsidiary Protection: The document does not provide information about access to permanent residency for those with subsidiary protection.
Indefinite Leave to Remain: Individuals who already have indefinite leave to remain do not face challenges in accessing permanent residency status, as they already possess it.
It is important to emphasize that UK immigration law is complex and subject to change. This information is general in nature and does not constitute legal advice. It is crucial to consult with an immigration lawyer or other qualified professional for specific guidance on individual circumstances.
