Q1	"Primary laws:
• Immigration and Asylum Act 1999
• The Immigration Rules
• 1951 Refugee Convention
• EU Settlement Scheme (Policy)
British and Irish Citizens, and individuals with pre-settled or settled status under the EU are allowed to work in the UK without a work permit, as per the EU Settlement Scheme1. Asylum seekers in the UK are normally prohibited from working while their asylum application is being considered2. However, as per the Immigration Rules, if their claim, or further submissions to their claim, has been pending for over 12 months, and the delay is not their fault3 , asylum
seekers may apply for permission to work. They can only work in jobs on the Immigration Salary List. They cannot be self employed4.
Recognised refugees have the right to work in the UK as per the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. This right to work is without restrictions. They may apply for a National Insurance Number. The same applies to those with Humanitarian protection5. The UK's restrictions on asylum seekers' right to (self-)employment while their claims are
pending may be considered limited in comparison to the Articles 17 and 18 of the 1951 Refugee
Convention. Additionally, the 12-month waiting period is longer than other international law
standards, such as the EU, which requires member states to allow asylum seekers to work after
nine months."	"Whilst the term is used informally, a “work permit” is not an officiial document or term in the UK.
However, individuals will only be eligible to “engage in wage-earning employment” in the UK if they
are either (i) UK / Irish nationals, (ii) have certain visas, (iii) have a pending asylum claim, (iv) have
indefinite leave to remain or (iv) have been granted refugee status. The following list outlines the
requirements for individuals “to engage in wage-earning employment” depending on an individual’s
status:
• UK and Irish nationals are exempt from requiring any visa to work in the UK.
• Part 3 of the European Withdrawal Agreement: European citizens who arrived in the UK
prior to the 31 December 2020 must have applied for the European Settlement Scheme to
continue to live and work in the UK.
• Part 3 of the European Withdrawal Agreement and the Immigration Rules (Appendix
Skilled Worker): European citizens who arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020 and all
other international nationals will only have the right to work through various visas. If the
citizen is in the UK solely for the purpose of work, they will need to obtain a Skilled Worker
Visa.
• However, there may be other visas which qualify an individual to work in “wage-earning
employment.” The following visa categories would allow for individuals to work in the UK
without a separate Skilled Worker Visa: Spouse or Partner visa, Student visa, Graduate visa
and start-up innovator visa. Guidance for the requirements of such visas can be found under
within the Immigration Rules.
• Part 8 of the Immigration Rules: “Indefinite Leave to Remain” (“ILR”) implies that you are
settled in the UK, and it is viewed as a stage before being eligible for outright British
Nationality. If you have ILR you are eligible to engage in “fee-earning work” in the UK. There
are numerous ways in which you can achieve ILR status. Anyone with Refugee status is able
to apply for ILR in the UK after spending 5 years in the UK.
• Part 11B of the Immigration Rules, paragraphs 360, 360A and 360B: sets out the policy
criteria for granting asylum seekers permission to take up employment. Asylum seekers can
work in a specific set of circumstances. The Home Office may grant permission to work (in
“wage-earning work”) to asylum seekers whose claim has been outstanding for more than 12
months through no fault of their own. However, their employment will be restricted to jobs
that are listed on the “Immigration Salary List.” This list is updated by the Home Office
regularly. Any permission to work will expire if the asylum application is refused.
• Paragraph 339 of the Immigration Rules: If you are granted Refugee Status you have the
right to work.

I will outline two primary limitations of the UK’s laws surrounding the question:
1. As the UK’s immigration laws operate in a dualist legal ecosystem, the primary constraint is
the fact that international law is only valid within the UK insofar as it is part of domestic law.
The 1951 Refugee Convention has been implemented through various pieces of legislation. It
has not been implemented exhaustively. UNHCR guidance, beyond the Convention and in
any format, has no formal authority and very little sway over a UK court’s adjudicative
jurisdiction. However, UK courts have been willing to allow the UNHCR to intervene in
ongoing proceedings (e.g. the recent Rwanda litigation). The intervention was deemed to be
persuasive in the individual case but did not give the UNHCR specific or perpetual authority
in terms of UK law.
2. The UK’s immigration laws are complex and a patchwork quilt of many different pieces of
primary legislation, secondary legislation and case law. For example, many of the key points
which answer the current question are derived from the Immigration Rules. The Immigration
Rules constitution secondary legislation. Whilst the rules are enfranchised by the
Immigration Act 1971, they are constantly updated by Home Office officials. Furthermore,
the rules and other legislation which puts the Convention into effect is animated by a
plethora of case law which is constantly evolving, making it hard for individuals to keep
abreast of changes."	"Asylum-seekers: British law generally bars asylum-seekers from paid work (page 79). They
may, however, seek permission from the Home Office after their claim has been
outstanding for a year (page 79). Applicants must provide personal and contact details as well as a statement requesting permission to work (page 79). There is no deadline by which
the Home Office must decide applications. It can take months (page 79). Permission only
applies to select occupations that are in shortage and self-employment is categorically
forbidden (page 79).
Recognized refugees: Yes. They have the same access to the United Kingdom's labor
market as citizens (page 118). And the government supports refugee job seekers through
language classes, professional training, interview practice, etc. (page 118). Obstacles
remain, however, like securing qualifications or ensuring existing ones are serviceable in
the United Kingdom (page 118).
Beneficiaries of humanitarian/subsidiary protection: Yes. They have the same access to
the United Kingdom's labor market as citizens (page 118). And the government supports
refugee job seekers through language classes, professional training, interview practice,
etc. (page 118). Obstacles remain, however, like securing qualifications or ensuring
existing ones are serviceable in the United Kingdom (page 118).
Indefinite leave to remainers: I couldn't find anything."

Q2	"• Immigration and Asylum Act 1999
• British Nationality Act 1981
• Immigration Rules
In the UK, refugees are granted temporary leave to remain upon recognition of their refugee
status. Initially, refugees are granted temporary leave to remain for a period of five years1. After
these five years, refugees can apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), as long as they have
resided continuously in the UK for five years, have satisfactory English and demonstrate good
character. After holding Indefinite Leave to remain for one year, refugees can apply for British citizenship if they meet the residency and character requirements under the British Nationality
Act 1981.
The process for a person with humanitarian protection is the same as refugees.2
The process for stateless persons in the UK is similar to refugees, but they must apply for
stateless leave under the Immigration Rules (Part 9). If granted stateless leave, they receive
temporary leave to remain in the UK for 5 years, after which they can apply for ILR."	"Yes, refugees and stateless persons have a path to permanent residency (also known as indefinite
leave to remain (“ILR”)) in the UK. However, they will have to follow a process and fulfil certain
requirements, both of which are outlined below:

Step 1:
• Refugees can apply for Refugee Status under Part 11 (Asylum) of the Immigration Rules. This
would grant them leave to remain.
• Stateless persons can apply for leave to remain under Part 14 (Stateless Persons) of the
Immigration rules. The applicants must demonstrate that they are not nationals of any other
state.

Step 2:
• If Refugees are successful in their application and are granted asylum, they are given leave to
remain for 5 years.
• If Stateless persons are granted leave to remain, they can usually stay in the UK for 5 years.

Step 3:
• After 5 years refugees, who were granted leave to remain, can apply for ILR under Paragraph
339R of the Immigration Rules.
• After 5 years stateless persons, who were granted leave to remain, can apply for ILR under
Part 14, Paragraph 405 of the Immigration Rules.

Permanent residency and ILR are used as interchangeable terms. However, the correct legal term is ILR. The ILR application has several components which are outlined in the Immigration Rules.
Applications will have to fill out various forms and poten2ally take tests regarding their knowledge of English and life in the United Kingdom.

Whilst it is not mandatory, individuals will be able to apply for citizenship a`er 12 months of holding
ILR."	"Asylum-seekers: No. To qualify, applicants must have continuously held refugee or
humanitarian/subsidiary protection for at least five years (page 109). Even if they have a
sponsor with permanent residency, family members do not receive the same status (page
115).
Recognized refugees: Yes. To qualify, refugees must have held refugee protection
continuously for at least five years (page 109). After, they must submit an application
which includes submitting documents to authorities in what can be a protracted process
(page 109). The United Kingdom Home Office can delay granting permanent residence to
those with a criminal history or extremist track record (page 109). In 2023, the United
Kingdom granted 29,676 refugees permanent residency status or “indefinite leave to
remain” (page 110).
Beneficiaries of humanitarian/subsidiary protection: Yes. To qualify, refugees must have
held refugee protection continuously for at least five years (page 109). After, they must
submit an application which includes submitting documents to authorities in what can be
a protracted process (page 109). The United Kingdom Home Office can delay granting
permanent residence to those with a criminal history or extremist track record (page 109)."
